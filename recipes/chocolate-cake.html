    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) package semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons instant coffee granules</li>

      <li>5 tablespoons water</li>

      <li>½ cup butter</li>

      <li>½ cup margarine</li>

      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>

      <li>6 egg yolks</li>

      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>

      <li>6 egg whites</li>

      <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar, for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch
        springform pan with 3-inch high sides. Wrap bottom of pan securely with
        aluminum foil so it comes up about 1-inch on the sides. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the chocolate chips with the instant coffee granules and water in a
        microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring
        after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave). Do
        not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Set aside to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat the butter, margarine, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a
        large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably
        lighter in color. Add the room-temperature egg yolks one at a time,
        allowing each egg yolk to blend into the butter mixture before adding
        the next. Pour in the flour gradually, mixing until just incorporated.
        Fold in the melted chocolate; mixing just enough to evenly combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl.
        Continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk
        straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its
        shape. Fold egg whites a third at a time into the chocolate mixture;
        mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour the batter into prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
        comes out clean, 1 hour to 1 hour and 5 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10
        minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Sift
        confectioners' sugar over the top of the cake before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
